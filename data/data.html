<h2>Day 10</h2>
<p>Today we learned about the pyramid python framework.  It feels like there is a lot going on with this framework, but it's also just the first day.  It's pretty awesome how a framwork will just build out an entire server for you.  I guess that makes the backend engineer's job a lot easier.  Routing is pretty cool, very interesting how you can load different html files in different places.  </p>
